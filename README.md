Cervo
=====

A lightweight and highly modular structure framework for PHP.


Requirements
------------

Requires *PHP 5.4.0*.

Does not depend on any other libraries.


Versioning
----------

Version model: (major).(minor).(hotfix)

 - **Major** version changes usually are major rewrites or a major change on how to use the system.
 - **Minor** version changes may affect the way the system is currently used, but will usually only take minor changes in the application to stay up-to-date.
 - **Hotfix** version changes are bug fixes and small feature additions. Nothing in your code should be changed.


Installing
----------

### Using composer

```
"require": {
    "manhim/cervo": "2.1.*"
}
```

### Manual install

Copy the *library* folder to your website. Rather then including composer's autoload in the example, you simply have to include the `bootstrap.php` file in the *Cervo* folder.

No packaging is currently made, but may be done if there is enough requests.


How to get started
------------------

You may read the code at [Manhim/Cervo-Example](https://github.com/Manhim/Cervo-Example) to get started with the file structure. More in-depths examples and tutorials are yet to come.
